      <h1 class="header">Squat</h1>
      <p>
        There are two types depending on equipment used: conventional stand and
        monolift stand. In case of the former lift is called walked out squat
        and in case of the latter lift is called monolift squat. Most
        powerlifting federations allow for monolift squats. The ones that do not
        are the IPF, IPL and the WDFPF.[45] The lift starts with the lifter
        standing erect and the bar loaded with weights resting on the lifter's
        shoulders. At the referee's command the lift begins. The lifter creates
        a break in the hips, bends their knees and drops into a squatting
        position with the hip crease (the top surface of the leg at the hip
        crease) below the top of the knee. The lifter then returns to an erect
        position. At the referee's command the bar is returned to the rack and
        the lift is completed.

          <h1 class="header">Rules For the Squat</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>After removing the bar from the racks while facing the front of the platform, the lifter may move forward or backward to establish the lifting position. The top of the bar not more than 3 cm below the top of the anterior deltoids. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders with the hands and/or fingers gripping the bar, and the feet flat upon the platform with the knees locked.</li>
            <li>The lifter shall wait in this position for the head referee's signal. The signal will be given as soon as the lifter is set and demonstrates control with the bar properly positioned. The head referee's signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and audible command "Squat".</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the head referee's signal, the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of knees.</li>
            <li>The lifter must recover at will, without double bouncing, to an upright position with the knees locked. The bar may stop, but there must be no downward motion during recovery. As soon as the lifter demonstrates a controlled final position, the head referee will give the signal indicating completion of the lift and to replace the bar.
            </li>
            <li>The signal to replace the bar will consist of a backward motion of the arm and the audible command "Rack". The lifter must then make a reasonable attempt to return the bar to the racks.
            </li>
            <li>The lifter shall face the front of the platform, towards the head referee.
            </li>
            <li>The lifter shall not hold the collars or discs at any time during the performance of the lift. However, the edge of the hands gripping the bar may be in contact with the inner surface of the collar.
            </li>
            <li>Not more than five and not less than two loaders/spotters shall be on the platform at any time.
            </li>
            <li>The lifter may enlist the help of spotters in removing the bar from the racks; however, once the bar has cleared the racks, the spotters shall not physically assist the lifter with regards to actually getting into the proper set position. The spotters may assist the lifter to maintain control should the lifter stumble or demonstrate any evident instability.
            </li>
            <li>The lifter will be allowed only one commencement signal per attempt.
            </li>
            <li>The lifter may be given an additional attempt at the same weight at the head referee's discretion if failure in an attempt was due to any error by one or more of the spotters.
            </li>
        
        </ul>
