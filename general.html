      <p>
        <h4>Q:How does judging work?</h2>
        A:The system for judging a powerlifting competition includes three referees (one of them is the head referee), each with their own set of two lights. The lights are red and white and indicate whether the lift was valid or not. The white light means “good lift” while the red light means “no lift.” Each referee will make their judgment and all three lights will display the decision simultaneously. The decision is made when 2 of 3 or 3 of 3 lights are the same color. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Q:What can I wear to a meet?</h2>
         A: Competition attire has several different requirements. The information below is not comprehensive, so be sure to review the federation’s rulebook to ensure your athletes are prepared. The following list provides a few of the current standards for the athletes’ attire during an IPF competition: 
          <ul>
            <li>Basic attire: singlet with straps that remain over the shoulders
            </li>
            <li>Socks: only 1 pair allowed; the sock cannot touch any part of the knee or knee support (knee wrap); the deadlift requires socks above the calf and below the knee to protect the shins
            </li>
            <li>Lifting belt: weight belt can be worn - 10mm or 13mm
            </li>
            <li> Wraps: wrist wraps and knee wraps (or sleeves if not equipped) can be worn (although both have size requirements that must be adhered to)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Q:How do I select openers for a meet?</h4>
          A: Generally your openers will be chosen in the gym about a week out from the meet, this is a weight with a movement that you feel confident you can do about 3 reps with before reaching failure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Q:How do I choose a weight class?</h4>
          A: Weight classes have been referred to as "height classes", fairly frequently. Generally if you are the tallest person in your weight class, you might consider moving up. However, as a beginner, its much better to just compete rather than trying to find your optimal weight class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Q:How do I choose a federation?</h4>
          A: Theres quite a few federations available in the US, thought theres TWO big federations, the USAPL(united states association of power lifting) and the USPA(United states powerlifting association), both have about the same amount of available meet, however the USAPL is considered the go to for most drug tested athletes, as winning in the USAPL can take you directly to IPF worlds. However the uspa has a few advantages, it allows the use of a deadlift bar, it has non tested meets, and meets are more readily available.

      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Q:What are those people sniffing?</h4>
          A: Smelling salts. Taking a big whiff of ammonia(smelling salts) before a lift will cause your body to give an adrenal response. This stimulates nerve endings, and increases your respiration, which will briefly hyper-oxegenate you. Essentially it's a slight physical, and palpable psychological boost before a lift.
      </p>
      <h4>Q:Where do I start?</h4>
      A: Numerous beginner programs are available, personal recommendation is the <a href="https://physiqz.com/workout-routines/powerbuilding-programs/greyskull-lp-best-powerbuilding-routine-beginners-gslp/">Greyskull</a> or <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">Stronglifts</a>.

      <h4>Q:Are you in pain?</h4>
      A: Yes.
