        <p>
          Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at
          maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift.
        </p>
        <p>
          As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete
          attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded
          with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd
          lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider
          variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts
          became standardized to the current three.
        </p>
        <p>
          In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped
          (typically referred to as 'classic' or 'raw' lifting in the IPF
          specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench
          shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee
          wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in
          others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting.
          Weight belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps and special footwear may also
          be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from
          un-equipped lifting.

        <p>Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each of the squat, bench press, and deadlift, depending on their standing and the organization they are lifting in. The lifter's best valid attempt on each lift counts toward the competition total. For each weightclass, the lifter with the highest total wins. In many meets, the lifter with the highest total relative to their weight class also wins. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks above the heavier lifter.[41]
        Competitors are judged against other lifters of the same gender, weight class, and age. This helps to ensure that the accomplishments of lifters like Lamar Gant, who has deadlifted 5 times his bodyweight, are recognized alongside those of Benedikt Magn√∫sson, the current All-time deadlift world record holder.
        </p>

        <p>A powerlifting competition, sometimes referred to as standard competition, there are three events: bench press, squat and deadlift. Placing is achieved via combined total. Some variations of this are found at some meets such as "push-pull only" meets where lifters only compete in the bench press and deadlift, with the bench press coming first and the deadlift after. Single lift meets (or full meets) are often held, sometimes alongside a normal 3-lift event. This is most common in the bench press.

            At a meet, the events will follow in order: squat, then bench press, and the deadlift will be the final lift of the meet. If the federation also has an event for strict curls, this will normally occur before the squat event.
